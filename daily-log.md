# Daily Learning Log – Data Engineering Journey

---

## Day 1 – Python CSV ETL

### What I built
- A Python ETL script that reads CSV input data
- Applied business rules using pandas
- Generated a clean output CSV after transformation

### Concepts learned
- ETL structure in Python (Extract, Transform, Load)
- pandas CSV handling
- Using pathlib for clean file paths

### Output
- Filtered completed orders from 2024 onwards

### Time spent
- ~2 hours

## Day 2 – Pandas GroupBy on Sales Data

### What I built
- A pandas aggregation pipeline on transactional sales data
- Generated regional revenue and quantity metrics

### Business Logic Applied
- Filtered only completed orders
- Considered data from 2026 onwards
- Aggregated sales metrics by region

### SQL Concepts Applied
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- COUNT, SUM, AVG

### Concepts learned
- Handling dates in pandas
- Multi-metric aggregations
- Translating business rules into code

### Output
- Regional sales summary CSV

### Time spent
- ~2 hours

### Repo Improvement
- Refactored folder structure to separate daily projects
- Organized Week 1 work into day-wise pipelines

Note: Reduced intensity due to fever. Focused on cleanup and structure. But I did show up. Keep it up!

## Day 3: IPL Data Analysis - Complete mini-project
**Time spent:** 3 hours
**What I learned:** 
- Complex groupby operations
- Multiple aggregations in one query
- Combining data from different analyses
- Creating professional README
- Project structure best practices
**What I built:** 
- Complete data analysis pipeline
- 4 different analysis outputs
- Professional documentation
**GitHub commits:** 1
**Files created:** 3 Python scripts, 2 CSV inputs, 4 CSV outputs, 1 README
**Blockers:** None
**Key insight:** Pandas groupby() is incredibly powerful - just like SQL GROUP BY but more flexible!
**Tomorrow's goal:** Connecting Python to PostgreSQL
